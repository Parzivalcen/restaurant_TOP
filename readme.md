This is my first webpage made with JS modules with the help of webpack, it is quite fun to work modules so far.

## Learned how deploy modular Websites as well
### Step 1
First we need to build our app. `npm run build`
Then we create a new branch e.g. gh-pages
### Step 2
  We need to make the dist or any other folder where our index.html is our root folder for the gh-pages branch.
 ```console
  git add dist && git commit -m "Initial dist subtree commit"
 ```
 ### Step 3
 Use the subtree push to deploy
```console
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages

```
